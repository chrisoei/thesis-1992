% The default line-spacing is 1.5.  You may want to use 2.0 for

% Change this by setting the \linespacing{} variable
% DON'T USE THE \baselinestretch{} command

% Use '\input epsf' if you want to insert Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)

\begin{document}

%
% The thesis.sty file is set up to work with a 3-line title,
% thus the \\ at the end of the first two lines.
% The title must be ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
% If you have a different number of lines you will have to
% modify ``thesis.sty'' to get the correct U. of I. spacing on
% your title page.
%

\title{
WALSH FUNCTION ANALYSIS OF \\
GENETIC ALGORITHMS \\
OF NON-BINARY STRINGS
}

% Your name must be exactly as it is in the Grad College records
% Again, this should be ALL CAPITAL LETTERS

\author{CHRISTOPHER KIANKHO OEI}

% The spacing here is correct for 2 other degrees.
% If you have just 1 other degree (or more than 2) you will
% have to adjust the spacing in the style file, 'thesis.sty'.
